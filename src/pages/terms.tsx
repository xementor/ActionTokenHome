You agree that ActionXR may employ any lawful mechanisms to detect and respond to cheating, fraud, and other behavior prohibited under these Terms, including checking your device for the existence of exploits or hacking and/or unauthorized software. Please see the Guidelines and our Privacy Policy for more information.

                    7 Participation in Events

                    7.1 Event Registration and Tickets

                    The term "Event(s)" means any in-person event, gathering, activity or the like which is directly organized, hosted, or managed by ActionXR, and any Promotion (as defined below). By registering or, where required, purchasing tickets for an Event, you represent and warrant that the information you provide is true and accurate. If you are registering or purchasing tickets on behalf of others, you represent and warrant you have all necessary rights and consents to register and provide this information for others.

                    Subject to applicable law and the exceptions set forth in these Terms, no refunds or exchanges of Event tickets are permitted and tickets are non-transferable. Reasonably acceptable proof of identity, for example a driver’s license or passport, showing the same first and last name as those provided at time of prior registration, may be required to access an Event. Actual or attempted resale of tickets subjects them to revocation without refund. Tickets obtained from unauthorized sources may be invalid, lost, stolen, or counterfeit and may not be honored. Tickets cannot be replaced if lost, stolen or destroyed. Commercial use of tickets is prohibited without written approval from ActionXR. Tickets are not redeemable for cash or credit. You agree to abide by any published ticket limits or restrictions, and orders exceeding or violating these restrictions are subject to cancellation without notice or refund. Events may have limited space and/or availability and ActionXR does not guarantee your ability to purchase a ticket or attend an Event.

                    Unless otherwise prohibited under applicable law, by attending an Event you acknowledge that ActionXR will use your data collected pursuant to the Privacy Policy for providing Event features (both in person and online), including contacting you and giving you updates about the Event, mailing you required materials (e.g., a QR wristband), providing emergency or severe weather notifications, or public Event leaderboards and gameplay competitions.

                    7.2 Event Conduct and Policies

                    You shall at all times comply with all applicable laws and any rules and policies provided by ActionXR or any other authorized party involved in creating or delivering the Event, including all health and safety policies and procedures and all reasonable instructions of the venue staff and ActionXR representatives at the Event. As a condition of participation, you agree to comply with all policies on the Sites, including, without limitation, any applicable Event website.

                    Illicit drugs, controlled substances, contraband, weapons and illegal items are prohibited at Events. You agree and consent to reasonable security precautions and search on entry. To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, you waive and release ActionXR and any other party involved in creating or delivering the Event from any and all claims, demands, causes of action, damages, losses, expenses or liability which may arise out of, result from, or relate in any way to such security precautions and/or searches. If you elect not to consent to such security precautions and searches, you may be denied entry, or removed from, an Event without refund or other compensation.

                    ActionXR and its authorized third parties reserve the right to refuse admission to, or to remove from an Event without refund or compensation of any kind, any person that (a) does not comply with these Terms, (b) engages in disorderly conduct or willful misconduct, or (c) ActionXR or its authorized third parties believe will cause a negative effect on the Event, participants, spectators, and/or personnel.

                    Any minor attending an Event must be accompanied by a Parent.

                    7.3 Assumption of Risks

                    Unless prohibited by applicable law, you agree that by purchasing tickets to, participating in or attending an Event, you willingly, knowingly and voluntarily assume any and all risks occurring before, during or after the Event, including injury by any cause and damage, loss, or theft of property. You acknowledge that Events, and certain activities at Events, have inherent and unforeseen risks, including but not limited to (a) contact or collision with persons or objects, (b) obstacles (e.g., natural and man-made water, road and surface hazards), (c) equipment related hazards (e.g., broken, defective or inadequate equipment, unexpected equipment failure), (d) weather related hazards, (e) inadequate first aid and/or emergency measures, (f) judgment and/or behavior related problems (e.g., erratic or inappropriate participant, co-participant, or spectator behavior or errors in judgment by personnel at the Event), and (g) natural hazards (e.g., uneven or difficult terrain, wildlife and insects, contact with plants). You agree to take reasonable precautions before attending or participating in an Event and its activities, for example consulting with a personal physician and ensuring you are in good physical health, wearing appropriate attire, and bringing necessary or recommended supplies. You further understand and acknowledge it is your responsibility to inspect the Event grounds, facilities, equipment and areas to be used, and that by participating in the Event, you acknowledge the Event grounds, facilities, equipment, and areas to be used are safe, adequate, and acceptable for participation. If you believe or become aware of any unsafe conditions or unreasonable risks, you agree to immediately notify appropriate personnel and cease participation in the Event.

                    To the extent permitted under applicable law, you hereby waive and release ActionXR and any other party involved in creating or delivering the Event from any and all claims, demands, causes of action, damages, losses, expenses or liability which may arise out of, result from, or relate in any way to your attendance or participation in an Event, including for negligence, inherent and unforeseen risks, injury or damage to persons or property and the actions of third parties or Event participants and spectators.

                    7.4 Event Features and Cancellation

                    Subject to applicable law, all schedules and any live or in-game experiences, activities, goods, services, perks, items, rewards and/or Content (collectively "Event Features") advertised in connection with an Event are not guaranteed and are subject to change and/or cancellation at any time prior to or during an Event without notice or compensation of any kind. Admittance to an Event does not guarantee any specific Event Features while at the Event.

                    Event date, time and/or location are subject to change at any time, and ActionXR will make a commercially reasonable effort to notify you in advance of any material changes. If an Event is canceled, suspended, or rescheduled and you are not able to attend, you will not be entitled to any compensation other than a refund of the ticket price at its face value with no further liability or compensation from ActionXR or any other party. Any travel or accommodation costs incurred are entirely your responsibility.

                    7.5 Recordings and Use of Likeness

                    You consent to and approve of ActionXR’s recording of your image, likeness, name, dialogue, biographic information, personal characteristics, and voice at Events and the royalty free use of this information subject to the same "Rights Granted by You" above. ActionXR may publish the results of any competitions (including rankings and any winners), gameplay statistics, and pictures of participants in promotional and marketing materials and on social media in accordance with these Terms.


                    8 Sweepstakes, Contests, Raffles, Surveys And Similar Promotions

                    Periodically, ActionXR and/or its partners may organize sweepstakes, contests, raffles, surveys, games, and similar promotions on the Services (each a "Promotion"). In addition to these Terms, Promotions will be subject to particular terms which we shall communicate to you at the time of these Promotions (“Promotional Terms”). By participating in any Promotion, you will become subject to those Promotional Terms. All Promotional Terms are incorporated into, may vary from, and shall supercede these Terms. ActionXR urges you to read the Promotional Terms. Our Privacy Policy, in addition to these Terms and any Promotional Terms, governs any information you submit in connection with such Promotions.


                    9 Beta Programs

                    ActionXR may offer you early access to certain pre-release mobile application software ("Beta Software") in order to allow you to test and provide feedback on Beta Software as part of ActionXR’s beta testing program (“Beta Program”). This Section only applies to closed Beta Programs, where ActionXR offers private access to selected testers. This Section does not apply to open betas that ActionXR makes publicly available on an app store.

                    You acknowledge that any product features or content, game documentation, promotional materials and/or any other information that ActionXR may provide to you in connection with the Beta Program ("Test Materials"), the Beta Software, as well as everything related to the Beta Program is the exclusive property of ActionXR, is confidential, and should be treated as confidential until such time as ActionXR releases it.

                    If ActionXR offers you access to the Beta Software, then, subject to your compliance with these Terms, ActionXR grants you a personal, non-exclusive, non-transferable, revocable, limited license to use the Beta Software solely for the purposes of testing and providing feedback on the Beta Software as part of the Beta Program.

                    Without limiting the foregoing and except as prohibited under applicable law, the following are prohibited and you may not:

                    copy, modify, or create derivative works based on the Beta Software;

                    give or sell the Beta Software to anyone;

                    reverse engineer, decompile, disassemble, decrypt or otherwise attempt to derive the source code of the Beta Software;

                    install the Beta Software on systems you don’t directly control or that you share with others;

                    discuss the Beta Software with or demonstrate it to anyone outside of ActionXR;

                    blog, tweet, or otherwise publicly post information about the Beta Software;

                    take screenshots, photos, videos, or audio recordings of the Beta Software unless ActionXR has allowed you to do so in writing; or

                    make Beta Feedback (as defined below) available to any third party, unless approved by ActionXR in writing and in advance.

                    Be careful when using the Beta Software in public. Do not allow anyone to see, hear, film, or photograph the Beta Software. Please notify ActionXR promptly of any unauthorized access or of any suspected breach of your account’s security.

                    ActionXR may collect your comments, suggestions, and feedback on the Software, and may also track your use of the Software through analytic tools, in accordance with ActionXR’s Privacy Policy. All such comments, suggestions, feedback, and analytic data (collectively, the "Beta Feedback") is the exclusive property of ActionXR.

                    You understand and agree that participation in the Beta Program is voluntary and does not create a legal partnership, agency, or employment relationship between you and ActionXR, and you will not be compensated for your participation or any Beta Feedback.  

                    Unless prohibited by applicable law, all Test Materials are provided to you "as is" without any explicit or implicit warranty of any kind. You understand that the Beta Software is in development and may contain errors, bugs, and other problems that could cause loss of data and/or system failure. You should install the Beta Software on non-production devices that are not business critical and have been backed up. To the extent permitted under applicable law, ActionXR is not liable in any way for any damages you might incur as a result of your participation in the Beta Program.

                    You agree that any breach of your confidentiality obligation will result in irreparable harm to ActionXR, the extent of which would be difficult to ascertain, and that monetary damages will not be an adequate remedy.  Accordingly, you agree that in the event you breach your confidentiality obligation, ActionXR will be entitled to injunctive or other equitable relief as the court deems appropriate, in addition to any other remedies which it may have available.

                    13 Dispute Resolution

                    YOU AGREE THAT DISPUTES BETWEEN YOU AND ACTIONXR WILL BE RESOLVED BY BINDING, INDIVIDUAL ARBITRATION, AND YOU ARE WAIVING YOUR RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY OR TO PARTICIPATE AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS ACTION OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING.

                    THIS NOTICE DOES NOT APPLY: (1) IF YOU ARE A RESIDENT OF THE EEA, OR ANY JURISDICTION WHICH DOES NOT ALLOW THIS ARBITRATION AGREEMENT, (2) IF YOU OPT OUT OF ARBITRATION AS DESCRIBED IN THE "ARBITRATION" SECTION BELOW, OR (3) TO CERTAIN TYPES OF DISPUTES DESCRIBED IN SECTION 13.1, “ARBITRATION,” BELOW.

                    13.1 Arbitration

                    If you live in the US or another jurisdiction which allows you to agree to arbitration, you and ActionXR agree that any disputes will be settled by binding arbitration, except that each party retains the right: (a) to bring an individual action in small claims court and (b) to seek injunctive or other equitable relief in a court of competent jurisdiction to prevent the actual or threatened infringement, misappropriation, or violation of a party’s copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, patents, or other intellectual property rights (the action described in this clause (b), an "IP Protection Action"). Notwithstanding this arbitration agreement, ActionXR reserves the right to bring an action in any court of competent jurisdiction against you to stop and/or seek compensation for the intentional or willful misuse or abuse (e.g. hacking or falsifying location) of its IP, products, and Services.

                    Without limiting the preceding paragraph, you will also have the right to litigate any other dispute if you provide ActionXR with written notice of your desire to do so by email to termsofservice@action-tokens.com within thirty (30) days following the date you first accept these Terms (such notice, an "Arbitration Opt-out Notice"). If you don’t provide ActionXR with an Arbitration Opt-out Notice within the thirty (30) day period, you will be deemed to have knowingly and intentionally waived your right to litigate any dispute except as expressly set forth in clauses (a) and (b) above. Further, unless both you and ActionXR otherwise agree in writing, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person’s claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of any class or representative proceeding. If this class action waiver is held unenforceable, then the parties’ agreement to arbitrate will be deemed void. Except as provided in the preceding sentence, this “Dispute Resolution” section will survive any termination of these Terms. If the terms of this Section 13.1 “Arbitration” are found unenforceable as to any claim for relief, that claim must be severed from the arbitration and brought pursuant to Section 13.6, “Governing Law and Exclusive Venue.” All other claims will be arbitrated. The arbitrator, and not any court or agency, shall have exclusive authority to (a) determine the scope and enforceability of this arbitration agreement and (b) resolve any dispute related to its interpretation, applicability, enforceability, or formation including any claim that all or any part of it is void or voidable.

                    13.2 Arbitration Rules

                    The arbitration will be administered by the American Arbitration Association ("AAA") in accordance with the Commercial Arbitration Rules and the Supplementary Procedures for Consumer-Related Disputes (the “AAA Rules”) then in effect, except as modified by this “Dispute Resolution” section. (The AAA Rules are available at https://www.adr.org/Rules or by calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879.) The Federal Arbitration Act will govern the interpretation and enforcement of this Section.

                    13.3 Arbitration Process

                    A party who desires to initiate arbitration must provide the other party with a written Demand for Arbitration as specified in the AAA Rules. (The AAA provides a general Demand for Arbitration) The single arbitrator will be either a retired judge or an attorney licensed to practice law and will be selected by the parties from the AAA’s roster of arbitrators. If the parties are unable to agree upon an arbitrator within fourteen (14) days of delivery of the Demand for Arbitration, then the AAA will appoint the arbitrator in accordance with the AAA Rules.

                    13.4 Arbitration Location and Procedure

                    Unless you and ActionXR otherwise agree, the arbitration will be conducted in a confidential manner, in the county where you reside. If your claim does not exceed $10,000, then the arbitration will be conducted solely on the basis of the documents that you and ActionXR submit to the arbitrator, and there will be no other discovery conducted (such as depositions), unless the arbitrator determines that a hearing is necessary. If your claim exceeds $10,000, your right to a hearing will be determined by the AAA Rules. Subject to the AAA Rules, the arbitrator will have the discretion to direct a reasonable exchange of information by the parties, consistent with the expedited nature of the arbitration. Notwithstanding the arbitrator’s discretion, absent a showing of good cause, in no event shall the parties be allowed more than three (3) depositions per side, and there will be no corporate deposition of the type contemplated by Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 30(b)(6) and California Code of Civil Procedure 2025.230.

                    13.5 Arbitrator’s Decision

                    The arbitrator will render an award within the time frame specified in the AAA Rules. The arbitrator’s decision will be treated as confidential, and will include the essential findings and conclusions upon which the arbitrator based the award. Confirmation and enforcement of the arbitration award may be done in any court of competent jurisdiction. The arbitrator’s award of damages must be consistent with the terms of Section 12 "Limitation of Liability" as to the types and amounts of damages for which a party may be held liable. The arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive relief only in favor of the claimant and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by the claimant’s individual claim. If you prevail in arbitration, you will be entitled to an award of attorneys’ fees and expenses to the extent provided under applicable law. ActionXR will not seek, and hereby waives, all rights it may have under applicable law to recover attorneys’ fees and expenses if it prevails in arbitration.

                    13.6 Governing Law and Exclusive Venue

                    To the extent that these Terms allow you or ActionXR to initiate litigation in a court, other than for small claims court actions, both you and ActionXR agree to the exclusive jurisdiction of and venue in the state and federal courts located in the Northern District of California. Each of the parties hereto waives any objection to jurisdiction and venue in such courts. These Terms and your use of the Services are governed by the laws of the State of California, excluding its conflicts-of-law rules. If you are resident in a member state of the EEA or a country in which this clause is prohibited by local law, this section does not apply to you, and does not deprive you of the protection of the mandatory provisions of the consumer protection laws in your country.

                    13.7 Fees

                    Our responsibility to pay any AAA filing, administrative, and arbitrator fees will be solely as set forth in the AAA Rules. However, if your claim for damages does not exceed $75,000, ActionXR will pay all such fees unless the arbitrator finds that either the substance of your claim or the relief sought in your Demand for Arbitration was frivolous or was brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 11(b)).

                    13.8 Changes to Dispute Resolution

                    Notwithstanding the provisions of the "Changes to Terms or Services" section above, if ActionXR changes this “Dispute Resolution” section after the date you first accepted these Terms (or accepted any subsequent changes to these Terms), you may reject any such change by sending us written notice (by email to termsofservice@action-tokens.com) within thirty (30) days of the date such change became effective, as indicated in the “Last Updated” date above or in the date of ActionXR’s email to you notifying you of such change. By rejecting any change, you are agreeing that you will arbitrate any Dispute between you and ActionXR in accordance with the provisions of this “Dispute Resolution” section as of the date you first accepted these Terms (or accepted any subsequent changes to these Terms).

                    17 Terms Specific to Residents of Germany

                    17.1 Limitation of Liability

                    In the event of intentional or gross negligence, including by its representatives and vicarious agents (Erfüllungsgehilfen), either Party shall be liable according to statutory provisions. The same shall apply in the event of culpably caused damages resulting from an injury to life, body or health, in the event of damages resulting from a violation of a guarantee as to quality (Beschaffenheitsgarantie), as well as in the event of defaults concealed fraudulently (arglistig verschwiegene Mängel).

                    In the event of damages to property and financial damages (Sach- und Vermögensschäden) caused by slight negligence of either Party, its representatives or vicarious agents, such Party shall be liable only in the event of a violation of a contractual core duty (wesentliche Vertragspflicht), however limited to the amount of the damage which was foreseeable at the time of conclusion of the contract and typical taking into account the nature of the contract (vorhersehbarer und vertragstypischer Schaden). Contractual core duties are such duties whose accomplishment enables proper fulfilment of an agreement and whose observance the contracting parties may and do regularly rely on.

                    Insofar as statutory limitations of liability acc. to Sec. 521, 599 German Civil Code apply to the provision of services free of charge, they remain unaffected by the aforementioned provisions.

                    Liability based on the German Product Liability Act shall remain unaffected.

                    Any further liability of either Party other than set out above shall be excluded.
